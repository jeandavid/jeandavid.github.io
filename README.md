# Jean-David Morgenstern &ndash; Software Engineer
I thrive in a creative and vigorous atmosphere where my coding skills and interpersonal skills are put in action. I have spent the past 4 years designing and building apps from zero to launch. This has given me experience with the entire life cycle of web and mobile apps, both on iOS and Android. From my entrepreneurial mindset I bring self discipline, courage, and open-mindedness, while my passion for coding remains constant. I write Swift code everyday.

## Hobbies
I love playing and watching football. I read the Wall Street Journal daily, the Economist weekly. Every day I learn something new on the technology I use, whether from medium.com, WWDC videos or one of the many swift newsletters I have subscribed to.
And of course, I love to hang out with my wife and our two amazing daughters.
