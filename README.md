## Hobbies
I love playing and watching football. I read the Wall Street Journal daily, the Economist weekly. Every day I learn something new on the technology I use, whether from medium.com, WWDC videos or one of the many swift newsletters I have subscribed to.
But hanging out with my wife and our two amazing young daughters is my favorite activity.
